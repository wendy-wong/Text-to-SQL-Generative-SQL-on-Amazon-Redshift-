I have provided a Data model using Microsoft Power BI for you to navigate and understand the database schema.
You may also download pre-processed datasets for you to experiment in generative SQL in Amazon Q within Amazon Redshift Serverless.
I have made available the datasets and data model here from Chapter 6.
I have provided also Intermediate and Advanced SQL handouts in my LinkedIn Course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/text-to-sql-amazon-redshift-serverless-for-generative-sql-in-amazon-q/text-to-sql-with-amazon-q?u=0
